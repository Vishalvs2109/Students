There are two ways to load this data into your SQL editor.

OPTION 1:

You can execute the create_student_grades_db.sql script, which will run several CREATE and INSERT statements to create the students and student_grades tables.

Note: This contains MySQL specific code such as "USE student_grades_db;", so you may need to comment that out for your particular flavor of SQL.

OPTION 2:

Use the graphical user interface (GUI) your SQL editor provides to point and click to load the students.csv and student_grades.csv files into your SQL editor.
